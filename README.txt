This code is designed to take in data from hospitals and make scheduling choices with an algorithm designed to reduce physician burnout, sars-cov-2 exposure, and take the guesswork out of scheduling in a chaotic environment such as a hospital.

The main.py file will take in functions and classes from the other *.py files that read the excel database example to output a notification to the physician. 

The notification functionality is not created yet.
